# Proposal 

A fighter game with solid combat skills. It will be an open-world game where you encounter various enemies and engage them in combat once you do. The enemy's difficulty will vary depending on their random move and mobility sets. Each adversary will present a unique challenge. There might or might not be a boss battle at the end, and every time you defeat an enemy, you might earn a new move or a benefit, like faster movement. It will be a pixelated game with a strong emphasis on the combat.
