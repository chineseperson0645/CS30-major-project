    - Engage in combat with entities (PVE) 
    - Engage with enviorment (Potions) [/]
    - Have abilities (Power Slash, Pocket Shot, Basic Stab) 
    - Move around in open world enviorment [/]

    Enviorment will need to be/have:
    - Open world [/]
    - Generating entities (Set Positions) [/]
    - Have interactable items (Set Postions)[/]
    - Have different locations (Village, Forest) [/]

    Game will need to:
    - Have entities (Singular boss and passives alike) 
    - Starting Screen [/]
    - Ending Screen

## Nice to Have List

- Easier Things:
- Lvl/Progression system (Enemy and Player)
- Custom Animated Charcter Engagement Screens 
- Walking animation [/]
- Fighting animation [/]
- Story/Lore [/]
- Final Boss
- Dialogue with entities [/] (Sort of)
- Loading Screen

- Randomly Generated Enemies

//Ask if we can add soundfx an bg music?

- Harder Things:

Remember, other things may take longer than even implementing getting off and on certain images/blocks
So try to distrubute time accordingly (namely, more evenly).
