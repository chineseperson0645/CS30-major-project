# What advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again?

I would probably tell myself to not focus so much on the little details and design, but to really hammer down on those "need to haves" because 
If I had only done that, at the very least I would've gotten a skeleton of what I needed to do which would've saved me a lot of stress and
time because then I wouldn't have needed to worry about my "need to haves" and could've just focused on making a good game afterwards.

Honesty I just wished I would've really just hunkered down and didn't concern myself with the littler detail but just focused on the foundation (need to haves)

I would also tell myself to not waste weeks on getting the movement right (transitioning between blocks while having the charcter ontop and image at the bottom).
What a waste of time.
