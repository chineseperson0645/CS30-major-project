# What advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again?

## Michael
I would probably tell myself to not focus so much on the little details and design, but to really hammer down on those "need to haves" because 
If I had only done that, at the very least I would've gotten a skeleton of what I needed to do which would've saved me a lot of stress and
time because then I wouldn't have needed to worry about my "need to haves" and could've just focused on making a good game afterwards.

Honesty I just wished I would've really just hunkered down and didn't concern myself with the littler detail but just focused on the foundation (need to haves)

I would also tell myself to not waste weeks on getting the movement right (transitioning between blocks while having the charcter ontop and image at the bottom).
What a waste of time.

ANOTHER HUGE THING I SHOULDVE SPENT TIME ON: Used a more efficent methods of cutting out sprite sheets and assets from the greyscale tileset.
By using sites like https://ezgif.com/ which has a sprite cutter

Another really big thing is I wished we (so both myself and probably AJ) would've found out about https://p5play.org/ sooner and used it sooner.

To Sum Up:
- Don't waste time on nice to haves. FOCUS ON NEED TO HAVES.
- Don't focus on little details if they aren't essential.
- Use automatic sprite cutters (Don't snip yourself, that's lame and time consuming).
- Use https://p5play.org/ WAYYY Earlier.

^Note to students next year: THIS WILL SAVE YOU SO MUCH TIME.

I would probably tell myself to...
If I were to start this project from scratch again, I would stay much more organized with my code. There were many times when my code became messy and hard to locate. The second would be to trust the process instead of being hesitant to change things up when the slightest things are not going the way I want them to. Third, I would tell myself to just have fun with it, there were times when I wanted to get the basics done that would include the boring stuff too that would kill the fun in it. Fourth, I think I was very ambitious in our expectations and goals however, I greatly underestimated the time it takes to learn these functions and new concepts so I had to cut some corners. Overall I enjoyed the experience of learning new ideas accompanied by a project that I am proud to put my name beside.
